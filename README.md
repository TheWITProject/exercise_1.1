## Summary
You will be working through some coding problems on [repl.it](https://www.repl.it/). When you have solved a problem, please copy and paste the solution into the codeblock below each question. Many of these problems can be solved using built-in methods. Try to solve them with and without!

Before you get started:
- clone this repo
- create and checkout a personal branch of this repo `git checkout -b <YOUR_NAME>_exercise_1.1`

When you are done:
- push up your personal branch `git push origin <YOUR_NAME>_exercise_1.1`
- open a PR for your branch
